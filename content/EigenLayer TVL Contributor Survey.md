 As of May 23, 2024, the total number of EOA addresses interacting with EigenLayer (on the ethereum network) is 183,880, about half of which have repledged ETH on EigenLayer. based on the contribution of these addresses to EigenLayer's total locked-in volume (TVL), we analyze the following results:

 Of the projects associated with EigenLayer, Puffer Finance is currently the largest contributor to EigenLayer's TVL, with Puffer now offering approximately 429,000 ETH. the second highest contributor is Mantle Treasury with 100,000 ETH pledged on EigenLayer, followed by Magpie, Renzo Protocol and Kelp DAO.

 Of the EOA addresses associated with EigenLayer, the largest contributor to the TVL is Justin Sun, who has contributed 104,001 ETH to the current TVL of EigenLayer.

 For more information on other addresses, you can refer to the table below. In the "EigenLayer" table, we analyze the label, entity, and type information of the TVL contributors on EigenLayer, as well as the label, entity, and type information of the addresses associated with those contributors. In the "Puffer Finance" and "Renzo Protocol" tables, we analyze the label, entity, and type information of TVL contributors in these two protocols. In both programs, TVL contributors may have contributed TVL through other contracts of the program, and to avoid duplication of data, the program itself will be the largest TVL contributor. We hope you find our survey helpful.
